## A simple tool for editing LightDM
`lightdm-config` is a script written in Bash to edit lightdm config as an anternative to `lightdm-set-defaults`  
It does not overwrite existing config files and is designed to be safe.  

## Warning
This tool is currently under development. I'm not used to regular expressions, so I may not be able to rewrite the settings normally.
